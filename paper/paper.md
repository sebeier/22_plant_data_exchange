# Introduction

This project will improve the integration of Plant data standards with important interoperability technologies. Indeed, some interoperability technologies have already been established with BrAPI, MIAPPE and ISA (Tab/JSON) for Phenotyping data, but the link between phenotype and omics data needs to be improved. The latter can rather be well described using bioschemas and therefore it will be useful for plant researchers to build a graph dataset embedding both MIAPPE and Bioschemas annotated data. We will enable plant researchers' friendly data archive by embedding the main plant standards (MIAPPE, BrAPI, ISA) in RO Crate. To link with the current activities of the plant communities, and to ease the integration of more diverse data types, a bridge with Bioschemas will be set up by finalizing the MIAPPE Bioschemas mapping initiated during the 2021 biohackathon. To demonstrate the interest of this, real data will be converted from existing sources (BrAPI, ISA Tab, MIAPPE databases) to RO Crate and Bioschemas to sketch some proof-of-concept use case (eg, showing phenotyping network on a map, showing the link between expression and phenotype data, â€¦).

# Formatting

This document use Markdown and you can look at [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of only two levels.

## Tables and figures

Tables can be added in the following way, though alternatives are possible:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

Table: Note that table caption is automatically numbered.

A figure is added with:

# ISA

# RO-Crate

Four RO-Crate profiles (see clear RO-crate profile example)
Flat structure and disentangle the ISA structure into indidual profiles, so that all metadata can be accessed directly and avoid nested structure. So as a practical result of this is that workflow system or tools have direct access to the metadata (e.g. GALAXY, Knowledge Graphs, etc). As a rule of thumb the annotation schema used for the description of the dataset is more general at the top of the hierarchy, when possible more general terms should be preferred when describing fields / parameters.

1. ISA-Investigation Profile: Description on the Investigation of the ISA only relying on Schema.org for type definitions. This enables global findability (e.g. Google Dataset Search). 
2. ISA-Study Profile: Description on an individual Study of the ISA in question relying on Bioschemas for type definitions (where possible).
3. ISA-Assay Profile: Description on an Assay of the ISA in question relying on ISA terminology.
4. MIAPPE Profile: Description of special MIAPPE related fields, not directly describable in Schema.org, Bioschemas, or ISA terms.

# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use CiTO annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate why you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
